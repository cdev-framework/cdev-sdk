# Cdev - Serverless Development Framework

The Cdev framework is designed to create a development environment that allows teams to harness the benefits of Serverless development by providing high level constructs and processes to reduce the friction of transitioning to Serverless development. By being built on a custom Infrastructure as Code framework, Cdev provides unqiue optimizations and flexibility that allows projects to start fast and scale naturally.
