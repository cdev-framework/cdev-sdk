[![](https://cdevframework.io/images/github_banner.png)](https://cdevframework.io)

The Cdev framework is designed to create a development environment that allows developers to harness the benefits of Serverless development. Cdev provides high level constructs and processes to reduce the friction of transitioning to Serverless development. By being built on a custom Infrastructure as Code framework, Cdev provides optimizations and flexibility that allows projects to start fast and scale naturally.
